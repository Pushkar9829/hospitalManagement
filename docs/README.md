## Module deep dives

Module-by-module specifications that go deeper than the PDF, with end-to-end and role-wise flows,
rules, settings, notifications, reports, formulas, edge cases, acceptance tests and a competitor
benchmark. Each has matching boards on the design canvas (see `ui-design/README.md`).

## Regenerating the PDF

The PDF is generated from the Python sources in `spec-src/` with ReportLab.

```bash
pip install reportlab
python3 docs/spec-src/build.py
```

Each chapter lives in its own `c*.py` file. Shared styles and diagram helpers are in
`spec-src/kit.py`.
