# Hospital Management System - UI/UX design

The full clickable design lives on a design canvas:
https://claude.ai/artifact/Fnp7CKPFT5jbiEFyMFNRq2
(private until the owner shares it from the canvas Share menu).

It has 112 boards on 15 pages, and 22 role panels (each role has its own home page, menu and data scope):

| OPD 1 · Module flow end to end | OPD overview and competitor benchmark, swimlane flow, alternate flows, status lifecycles, rules and tests, OPD settings, OPD analytics |
| OPD 2 · Role-wise flows | OPD flow for patient, call centre, front office, cashier, nurse, doctor, pharmacy and lab, OPD admin, management, with their screens |
| IPD 1 · Module flow end to end | IPD overview and competitor benchmark, swimlane flow (admission advice to bed turnaround), 13 alternate flows, status lifecycles, rules and tests, IPD settings, IPD analytics |

## Files here

- `../modules/OPD.md`: full OPD module specification (flows, rules, roles, tests, benchmark).
- `../modules/IPD.md`: full IPD module specification (admission to discharge, insurance, beds, billing, roles, tests, benchmark).
- `panels.md`: every role panel with its home page, menu and data scope. Start here.
- `screens.md`: every screen with route, role, module, permission and APIs.
- `tokens.json`: colours, type, spacing and radius for the MUI theme.
- `boards/`: the source of every board (`.dc.html`). They run inside the design canvas,
  not as standalone pages; open the canvas link to view and click through them.
- `source/`: the building blocks used to generate the app-screen boards
  (shared shell, per-screen body, per-screen data). `python3 source/build.py <Name> ...`
  rebuilds one board using the arguments listed in `source/screens.tsv` and `source/homes.tsv`;
  role menus come from `source/parts/panels.json`. `source/opd/` and `source/ipd/` generate the
  module flow diagrams and role boards (`python3 source/ipd/flow.py boards`, and so on);
  `python3 source/ipd/mkdoc.py ../modules/IPD.md` regenerates the IPD specification.

The functional specification, API documentation and deployment guide are in
`../Hospital_Management_System_Phase1_Specification.pdf`.
